#1 Data Retrieval: Access the 'movie -> date' path to obtain the release date. Extract the last four
#characters of the release date to obtain the movieâ€™s release year

#2. Company Identification: Access the 'movie -> companies' path to identify the production 
#companies associated with the movie. Note that a movie may be jointly produced by multiple 
#companies, but for our task, we only need to count the top three production companies. This 
#means that if a movie is produced by five companies, only the first three will be considered.

#3 Data Formatting: Generate a series of pairs for each movie in the following format: <year, 
#company>. This can be achieved by combining the movie's release year (extracted in Step 1) 
#with the names of the top three production companies (identified in Step 2).

            company_name = movie_doc['companies'][i]["name"]
            year_comp.append((year, company_name))


# 4. Data Storage: Store <year, company> pairs of all movies into a text file. This text file will 
# serve as the input data for the subsequent MapReduce program
# Save the pairs to a text file
