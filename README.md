# Big Data Assignments - MapReduce & R-tree Range Queries

## Description
This repository contains the Python scripts and data for two Big Data assignments completed at Macquarie University. Assignment 1 focuses on using MapReduce for movie data analysis, while Assignment 2 involves constructing an R-tree for efficient range querying on spatial data.

### Assignment 1: MapReduce for Movie Data Analysis
#### Files
- `task1_extraction.py`: Extracts movie release dates and production companies from a database.
- `task1_count.py`: MapReduce program to calculate the frequency of movies released by each company per year.
- `task2_mergesort.py`: Merge sort algorithm in a MapReduce framework for alternative sorting.
- `task2_bucketsort.py`: Bucket sort algorithm implemented in a MapReduce framework.


#### Project Overview
- Uses MapReduce to process and analyze movie data.
- Demonstrates data counting, sorting, and extraction with MapReduce.

### Assignment 2: R-tree Range Queries
#### Files
- `assignment2_final.py`: Core Python script for constructing the R-tree and processing range queries.
- `Dataset for R-Tree Construction.txt`: Spatial data points for R-tree construction.
- `200 Range Queries.txt`: 200 range queries for performance analysis.

#### Project Overview
- Focuses on building an R-tree and analyzing its performance in processing range queries.
- Compares the efficiency of the R-tree against a sequential scan approach.

## Technologies
- Python
- mrjob Library for MapReduce
- Data Structures (R-tree)

## Installation and Usage
1. **Python Setup**: Ensure Python 3.9 is installed along with necessary libraries.
2. **Clone Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your system.
3. **Run Scripts**: Execute the Python scripts as per the requirements of each assignment.

## Results and Discussion
- **Assignment 1**: Efficient processing of movie data using MapReduce, with implementations of bucket and merge sort algorithms in a distributed computing environment.
- **Assignment 2**: Enhanced query response time and scalability using an R-tree for spatial data indexing and querying.
